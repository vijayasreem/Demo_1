Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that can be used for the Loan Applicant Credit Check and Pre-Qualification Report Generation System:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/credit_check', methods=['POST'])
def perform_credit_check():
    # Retrieve loan applicant information from the request
    loan_applicant = request.json

    # Perform credit check and retrieve credit score from a reliable source
    credit_score = get_credit_score(loan_applicant['ssn'])

    # Evaluate loan applicant's financial history
    financial_history = evaluate_financial_history(loan_applicant)

    # Assess creditworthiness based on credit score and financial history
    creditworthiness = assess_creditworthiness(credit_score, financial_history)

    # Generate pre-qualification report
    report = generate_report(loan_applicant, credit_score, creditworthiness)

    # Return the pre-qualification report as JSON response
    return jsonify(report)

def get_credit_score(ssn):
    # Retrieve credit score from a reliable source using the loan applicant's social security number (ssn)
    # You can implement the logic to retrieve the credit score from an external API or database
    credit_score = 750  # Assuming the credit score is retrieved successfully
    return credit_score

def evaluate_financial_history(loan_applicant):
    # Evaluate loan applicant's financial history, including income, debts, and previous loan repayments
    # You can implement the logic to evaluate the financial history based on the loan applicant's provided information
    financial_history = {
        'income': loan_applicant['income'],
        'debts': loan_applicant['debts'],
        'previous_loan_repayments': loan_applicant['previous_loan_repayments']
    }
    return financial_history

def assess_creditworthiness(credit_score, financial_history):
    # Assess creditworthiness based on credit score and financial history
    # You can implement the logic to assess creditworthiness based on your business rules
    creditworthiness = 'High'  # Assuming the creditworthiness is determined successfully
    return creditworthiness

def generate_report(loan_applicant, credit_score, creditworthiness):
    # Generate pre-qualification report
    report = {
        'loan_applicant': loan_applicant,
        'credit_score': credit_score,
        'creditworthiness': creditworthiness
    }
    return report

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask application with a single route `/credit_check` that accepts a POST request. Inside the route function `perform_credit_check`, we retrieve the loan applicant information from the request JSON, perform a credit check by calling the `get_credit_score` function, evaluate the financial history using the `evaluate_financial_history` function, assess the creditworthiness using the `assess_creditworthiness` function, and generate the pre-qualification report using the `generate_report` function. Finally, we return the pre-qualification report as a JSON response.

You can customize and expand this code according to your specific requirements.
